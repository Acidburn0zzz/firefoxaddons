You can drag a box around the links you want to open and let go of the right mouse button to open them using the default action.

Alternatively, you can left click after drawing a selection with the right mouse button still pressed down, and choose any of the actions from the menu to save time by changing the actions in options:

If you would like to cancel a selection, you can do this by simply left clicking after you have drawn a selection and choosing cancel, or pressing the Esc Key on your keyboard.
