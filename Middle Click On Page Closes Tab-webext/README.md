Middle Click On Page Closes Tab
=============

Middle click on a page to close the current tab. You can middle click by pressing the scroll wheel on your mouse.

Please note that this addon cannot be used alongside Double Click Closes Tab when Double Click Closes Tab is configured to close the current page with the middle mouse button, since that will close two tabs at once (instead of one).

This addon does not work on these pages:
* about: pages
* priviledged websites such as addons.mozilla.org (caused by security restrictions)
* Flash websites

This addon disables autoscrolling to make middle mouse click work for everyone. For more information on autoscrolling, see http://www.ghacks.net/2014/10/14/how-to-disable-middle-mouse-button-scrolling-in-chrome/
