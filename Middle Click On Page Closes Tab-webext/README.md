Middle Click On Page Closes Tab
=============

Middle click on a page to close the current tab.

Please note that this addon cannot be used alongside Double Click Closes Tab when Double Click Closes Tab is configured to close the current page with the middle mouse button, since that will close two tabs at once (instead of one).
