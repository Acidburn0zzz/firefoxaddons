Middle Click On Page Closes Tab
=============

Middle click on a page to close the current tab. You can middle click by pressing the scroll wheel on your mouse.

Please note that this addon cannot be used alongside Double Click Closes Tab when Double Click Closes Tab is configured to close the current page with the middle mouse button, since that will close two tabs at once (instead of one).

This addon does not work on these pages:
* about: pages
* priviledged websites such as addons.mozilla.org (caused by security restrictions)
* Flash websites

This addon disables autoscrolling by default to make middle mouse click work for everyone. For more information on autoscrolling, see http://www.ghacks.net/2014/10/14/how-to-disable-middle-mouse-button-scrolling-in-chrome/

If you want autoscrolling enabled on every page, you can enable autoscrolling in the options. It works this way:
* Short middle click to close a tab. The autoscrolling icon will be present as long as you don't left click or escape, but it won't do anything. Short is defined as <200ms.
* Long middle click: start autoscrolling. Long is defined as >=200ms.

If you want autoscrolling enabled on the current page, you can press Escape on your keyboard. Now autoscrolling is enabled for the current page. It works the same way as above.

Please note that autoscrolling will not work if your mouse/operating system doesn't support it. Please do not enable the option "Enable autoscrolling on every page" if your mouse/operating system does not support autoscrolling.
