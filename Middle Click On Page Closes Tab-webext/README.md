Middle Click On Page Closes Tab
=============

Middle click on a page to close the current tab. You can middle click by pressing the scroll wheel on your mouse.

Please note that this addon cannot be used alongside Double Click Closes Tab when Double Click Closes Tab is configured to close the current page with the middle mouse button, since that will close two tabs instead of one.

This addon does not work on these pages:
* about: pages
* priviledged websites such as addons.mozilla.org (caused by security restrictions)
* Flash websites

This addon disables autoscrolling by default to make middle mouse click work for everyone. For more information on autoscrolling, see http://www.ghacks.net/2014/10/14/how-to-disable-middle-mouse-button-scrolling-in-chrome/

If you want autoscrolling enabled on every page, you can enable set "Enable autoscrolling" to "On every page" in the options. It works this way:
* Short middle click to close a tab. The autoscrolling icon will be present as long as you don't left click or escape, but it won't do anything. Short is defined as <300ms. This timeout be changed.
* Long middle click: start autoscrolling. Long is defined as >=300ms. This timeout be changed.

If you want autoscrolling enabled on the current page, you can press Shift+Escape on your keyboard (or any other key/shortcut that you have defined in the options). It only works for "on demand" mode. Now autoscrolling is enabled for the current page. It works the same way as above.

Please note that autoscrolling will not work if your mouse/operating system doesn't support it. Please do not set "Enable autoscrolling" to "On every page" if your mouse/operating system does not support autoscrolling.
